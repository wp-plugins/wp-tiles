Currently, all future features have no target version attached to them. Whoever wants to can add them or if there are enough requests, some features will get priority:
* Filter by Post Category (on the front end)
* Option to automatically add IE compat header
* Multiple breakpoints
* Infinite Scroll option?
* Sliders on tiles
